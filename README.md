## ✍️ About
Arsenal of Knowledge is more than a blog — it is an evolving platform dedicated to amplifying voices, questioning stale narratives, and nurturing a culture of rigorous thinking among Gen Z and beyond.

Founded by Emmanuel Beneth, a political science graduate, researcher, and award-winning student leader passionate about governance, equity, and transformative policies, this space was born out of a keen frustration with surface-level conversations and an even deeper desire to provoke meaningful reflection.
